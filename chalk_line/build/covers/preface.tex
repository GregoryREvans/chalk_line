A Chalk Line is a device used for the creation of straight lines to aid in the construction of buildings. A length of string covered in chalk (or sometimes ink) powder is stretched across a flat surface, which is then pulled back and snapped onto the surface, leaving a straight line of the dust behind. This piece consists of three subsections entitled ``Calligraphy,'' ``Spirals,'' and ``Afterimage'' respectively.

\pmb{Pitch} : \circled{1} Accidentals apply only to the pitch which they immediately precede, but persist through ties. \circled{2} Where no trilled pitch is notated, all trills should be performed as minor seconds.

\pmb{Grace Notes} : Grace notes should be played as fast as possible. This means that some grace figures may require a slower speed than others. All grace figures should occur before the beat, allowing the following note's attack to occur as written. As such, grace figures will shorten the duration of the note which precedes them.

\pmb{Alternate Timbres} : Bisbigliando is notated as a trill preceded by the abbreviation \textit{Bis.}, while rhythmicized timbre alterations are notated as a circled number above a note (such as \circled{1}, \circled{2}, or \circled{3}), where higher numbers refer to a greater deviation in timbre and pitch.

\pmb{Time} : \circled{1} Accelerandi and Ritardandi are written as transitioning metronome marks. \circled{2} No pause should be taken to seperate the sections which are divided with double bars, but should be performed one directly into the next.

\pmb{Multiphonics} : The included fingering charts are derived from Carin Levine's \textit{Die Spieltechnik der Fl\"ote}. The written pitches are desired and alternate fingerings may be employed as necessary. Indicating Page-Row-Column, the charts can be found in the book at 76-1-3, 76-1-4, 76-3-4, 89-2-3, 88-5-3, 95-3-3, 95-4-4, 77-5-1, 77-4-1, 79-3-2, 82-5-3, 77-1-1, 97-5-4, 103-4-2, 91-4-1.

\pmb{Miscellaneous} : \circled{1} Triangle note heads indicate \textit{pizzicato}. \circled{2} Slash noteheads indicate a tone color that contains mostly air sound and some pitch while \circled{3} the hybrid notehead indicates equal parts air and pitch. \circled{4} The performer is at liberty to slur any notes with the exception of those with distinct articulations.
